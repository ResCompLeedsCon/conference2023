It’s been nearly two months since ResBaz – _how are your superpowers developing_? We hope your digital research skills journey is going well!

We’ve published all the presentations we can to a [ResBaz Auckland 2019 Collection](https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.c.4651262.v2) within our institutional Data Publishing and Discovery Service.

Keep in touch with us and each other - pop by Hacky Hour, 3-4pm Thursdays at the Strata Café, join the [Slack channel](http://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour), or follow [@eResearchUoA](https://twitter.com/eresearchuoa) on Twitter.

Bye for now!
